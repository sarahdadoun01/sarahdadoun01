# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m @sarahdadoun01, real name â€” Sarah Dadoun

I love learning and I want to spend my life designing and building awesome apps, websites and softwares. I'm not afraid of challenging myself. I spent most of my 20's in college, discovering what I ultimately wanted to do in life. Through countless courses and experiences, I realized my true passion lies in programming, and I've been pursuing it ever since.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in arts, software development and web development.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently in my last College Semester in computer science programming, which is one of my favorite parts of my day.

ðŸ¤“ Some college in Interior Design, graduated in Graphic Design, finishing up Computer Science, and an experienced Eyelash Technician.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a mom to a toddler!
